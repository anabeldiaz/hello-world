Here is a little bit about me. 
Hello! My name is Anabel and I am a junior studying MIS and Economics. I am really excited about my internship this summer at Protiviti where I will be a tech consultant. This is actually not my first time using GitHub. I am currently taking a Web Development class (IT 263). The current website I am making is a ecommerce site that focuses on selling annotated books.
